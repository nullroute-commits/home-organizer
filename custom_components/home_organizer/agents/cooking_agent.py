# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# // [v9.9.7 | 2026-04-19] Purpose: Unified first-turn presentation + free-form
# //   questions. Major UX changes requested by the user:
# //
# //   1. FIRST-TURN FULL PRESENTATION. STATE 1 is renamed "recipe_full"
# //      and now returns the COMPLETE recipe -- title, have/missing
# //      ingredients, AND all preparation steps -- in a single turn.
# //      The old two-stage "overview then show full" flow is gone; the
# //      user sees everything immediately.
# //
# //   2. STEP-BY-STEP REUSES THE DISPLAYED RECIPE. STATE 3 now prefers
# //      the steps/timers/ingredients already stored in recipe_state
# //      over whatever the LLM returns. This guarantees "start step by
# //      step" walks through the EXACT same recipe the user just saw,
# //      not a regenerated version that might differ.
# //
# //   3. FREE-FORM QUESTIONS (STATE 2). While a recipe is active, the
# //      user can ask anything about it -- "How do you recommend
# //      decorating the cake?", "How long does it keep?", "What pan
# //      size?" -- and get a conversational answer without modifying
# //      the recipe state. Distinct from STATE 4 (fix_recipe) which is
# //      for quantity/substitution changes.
# //
# //   4. RENDERER EXTENDED. _render_recipe_overview now includes a
# //      localized "Preparation:" section listing every step. Hebrew,
# //      Arabic, Russian, German, Dutch, Portuguese all localized.
# //
# //   SAVE_RECIPE unchanged — it already stores the three columns the
# //   user asked for (name, ingredients, steps). Just confirmed it
# //   picks up the full steps from the now-richer state.
# // [v9.9.6 | 2026-04-19] Preserve recipe identity (fix-first + switch confirm).
# // [v9.9.5 | 2026-04-18] CRITICAL fix for saved-recipe completeness.
# // [v9.9.2 | 2026-04-18] Purpose: Fixes after live testing in Hebrew:
# //   1. Continuation HINT is now localized per language (Hebrew, Arabic,
# //      Russian, etc). Previously it always said "Say next to continue"
# //      in English even inside a Hebrew conversation.
# //   2. Localized STEP_LABEL_MAP for dictation mode so step prefixes
# //      rendered by our own code use the correct word ("שלב" for
# //      Hebrew, "Paso" for Spanish, etc) instead of hardcoded "Step".
# //   3. STATE 5 (shopping_sync) prompt hardened with an ABSOLUTE
# //      NO-QUESTION RULE and a full Hebrew WORKED EXAMPLE. The LLM no
# //      longer asks "do you want to increase the quantity of X" during
# //      shopping-sync turns.
# //   4. _push_to_shopping_list gained a belt-and-suspenders number
# //      extractor: if the LLM still returns requested_qty=1 while
# //      sending a qty_needed string like "200 grams", the code itself
# //      parses the first integer out of qty_needed and uses it. Same
# //      for unit detection.
# //   5. Cooking prompt's "Step 1:" placeholders replaced with neutral
# //      "<step 1 in target_lang>" so the LLM stops leaking the English
# //      label into Hebrew output.
# // [v9.9.1 | 2026-04-18] Purpose: Initial quantity-extraction + no-ask
# // hardening, HINT_MAP pass. Superseded by 9.9.2.
# // [v9.9.0 | 2026-04-18] Purpose: Saved recipes + automatic timers +
# // manual recipe dictation. Four new capabilities layered on top of the
# // v9.8 multi-state agent:
# //   A. DB-FIRST LOOKUP. When the user asks for "<dish>", we first query
# //      recipes_db for a stored match and ask if they want to use it
# //      before hitting the LLM. Saved recipes load instantly and skip
# //      token cost entirely.
# //   B. AUTO-SAVE. After the user finishes step-by-step mode we save
# //      the whole recipe (ingredients + steps + timers) to the DB so
# //      it's available next time.
# //   C. AUTO TIMERS. In FAST PATH mode, if the step we are about to
# //      deliver has a timer attached, we persist a reminder to
# //      scheduled_reminders, announce it ("Timer set for 45 minutes"),
# //      AND keep the step text so they still see what to do.
# //   D. MANUAL DICTATION. A new dictation state lets the user build a
# //      recipe step by step, with optional timers per step, without
# //      the LLM inventing anything.
# // [v9.8.0 | 2026-04-18] Previous multi-state rewrite (inventory diff,
# // shopping_sync, step-by-step hardening, reminder handoff logging).

====================

CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE: Your ENTIRE spoken output MUST be strictly in {target_lang}. Every string inside "steps", "recipe_title", "ingredients.name", "ingredients.qty", "timers.label", "have.*", "missing.*", "spoken_confirmation", "spoken_question", "spoken_prompt", "reply_message", "follow_up_question" and "message" -- ALL of them -- MUST be written in {target_lang}. The word "Step" is a LABEL placeholder only: write the step number prefix naturally in {target_lang} (for Hebrew use the Hebrew word for "Step" followed by the number, for Spanish use "Paso 1:", for French "Etape 1:", for Italian "Passo 1:", for German "Schritt 1:", etc). Do NOT output English phrases unless {target_lang} is English.
CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE: Return ONLY a single valid JSON object. No text outside the JSON. No markdown fences.

Classify the user's latest intent into EXACTLY ONE of these states and return the matching JSON.

=====================================================================
[STATE S0 - SUGGEST SAVED RECIPE]
=====================================================================
Trigger: The user asked for a recipe AND one or more entries in SAVED RECIPES clearly match the dish AND CURRENT RECIPE STATE is "None".
Action: Offer the best saved match and ask if they want to use it.
{{"intent": "suggest_saved", "saved_id": "<id from SAVED RECIPES>", "saved_name": "<name from SAVED RECIPES>", "spoken_question": "<Ask in {target_lang}: I have a saved recipe for X. Want to use it, or should I build a fresh one?>"}}

=====================================================================
[STATE 1 - FULL RECIPE PRESENTATION (first time)]
=====================================================================
Trigger: The user asked for a recipe AND no good saved match exists AND CURRENT RECIPE STATE is "None".

Return the COMPLETE recipe in a single turn: title, ingredients split into have/missing AND the full step-by-step preparation. The user will read everything at once and then decide the next action (add missing to shopping, start step-by-step cooking with this exact recipe, or ask a question about it).

For every step that contains a wait/bake/cook/rest time, emit an entry in the "timers" array. step_index is 0-based (step 1 is index 0, step 2 is index 1, etc).

{{
  "intent": "recipe_full",
  "recipe_title": "<recipe name in {target_lang}>",
  "have": [{{"name": "<{target_lang}>", "qty_needed": "<e.g. 200g>", "location": "<short spoken location in {target_lang}>"}}],
  "missing": [{{"name": "<{target_lang}>", "qty_needed": "<e.g. 3 eggs>", "category": "<English category>"}}],
  "steps": ["<step 1 in {target_lang} — prefixed with the localized word for 'Step 1:'>", "<step 2 in {target_lang}>", "..."],
  "timers": [{{"step_index": 1, "minutes": 20, "label": "<{target_lang}>"}}],
  "follow_up_question": "<Ask in {target_lang}: add missing to shopping list, start step-by-step, or ask a question about the recipe?>"
}}

=====================================================================
[STATE 2 - ANSWER A QUESTION ABOUT THE RECIPE]
=====================================================================
Trigger: CURRENT RECIPE STATE is not empty AND the user asks a free-form question about the recipe that is NOT a quantity tweak (that is STATE 4) and NOT step navigation. Examples:
  - "How do you recommend decorating the cake?"
  - "What can I serve this with?"
  - "How long does it keep in the fridge?"
  - "Can I make this ahead of time?"
  - "What if I don't have vanilla?"
  - "What pan size should I use?"

Return a conversational answer in {target_lang}. Do NOT modify the recipe state. Do NOT re-send steps or ingredients.

{{"intent": "reply", "message": "<full conversational answer in {target_lang}>"}}

=====================================================================
[STATE 3 - START STEP-BY-STEP COOKING]
=====================================================================
Trigger: User says "start", "step by step", "begin", "ok", "ready", "let's go", AND CURRENT RECIPE STATE has all_steps (from the recipe_full turn).

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- You MUST return intent "init_recipe".
- NEVER concatenate steps into a single "reply" message.
- REUSE the exact steps and timers from CURRENT RECIPE STATE -- do NOT rebuild or rewrite them.
- The user sees only ONE step at a time. The agent advances on "next".

{{
  "intent": "init_recipe",
  "recipe_title": "<same recipe_title from state>",
  "ingredients": "<same ingredients from state>",
  "steps": "<copy all_steps from CURRENT RECIPE STATE verbatim>",
  "timers": "<copy timers from CURRENT RECIPE STATE verbatim>"
}}

=====================================================================
[STATE 4 - FIX / ADJUST / QUESTION DURING ACTIVE COOKING]
=====================================================================
Trigger: The CURRENT RECIPE STATE already has a non-empty "all_steps" array AND the user sends ANYTHING that can be interpreted as adjusting, substituting, reducing, or asking about THIS recipe -- including brand-new quantity requests.

⚠ ABSOLUTE RULE -- "FIX FIRST" ⚠
When a recipe is already active (all_steps is not empty), you MUST treat the user's message as a FIX to the current recipe UNLESS the user explicitly uses words like "new recipe", "different recipe", "switch recipe", "cancel this recipe", "forget this recipe" (in any language). This applies EVEN IF the user's message looks like a fresh recipe request.

Concrete examples that MUST route to fix_recipe (NOT recipe_overview, NOT init_recipe):
  - "I want a recipe for 1 cup of rice"     (user is inside an active sushi recipe -> scale sushi down to 1 cup rice)
  - "use 2 eggs instead of 3"                (swap quantity in current recipe)
  - "less salt"                              (reduce salt in current recipe)
  - "can I replace butter with oil"          (substitute in current recipe)
  - "make it smaller"                        (halve the current recipe)
  - "I only have 100g of cheese"             (adjust current recipe to match)
  - "I prefer more sauce"                    (increase an ingredient in current recipe)

Concrete examples that MUST route to switch_recipe (see STATE 9):
  - "I want a new recipe"
  - "forget this, cook something else"
  - "give me a different recipe"
  - "cancel this and start over"
  - "נעבור למתכון חדש"

What to do in STATE 4:
1. Read CURRENT RECIPE STATE carefully -- you have the recipe_title, ingredients, full all_steps, current_idx and remaining_planned_steps.
2. Apply the user's change to the EXISTING recipe (keep the same dish). If they asked to use less rice, that is still the SAME sushi recipe with a smaller rice quantity, NOT a plain rice recipe.
3. Acknowledge what you changed in reply_message (short, in {target_lang}).
4. Regenerate the REMAINING steps from current_idx onward with the adjustment baked in. Preserve the dish identity (sushi stays sushi, cheesecake stays cheesecake).
5. Also update remaining timers for those new steps.

{{
  "intent": "fix_recipe",
  "reply_message": "<short advice in {target_lang}, e.g. 'Scaling sushi down to 1 cup of rice. Adjusting remaining steps.'>",
  "updated_remaining_steps": ["<step N in {target_lang}>", "<step N+1 in {target_lang}>"],
  "updated_remaining_timers": [{{"step_index": 0, "minutes": 15, "label": "<{target_lang}>"}}]
}}

=====================================================================
[STATE 5 - ADD MISSING INGREDIENTS TO SHOPPING LIST]
=====================================================================
Trigger: User confirms they want the missing items added to the shopping list.

ABSOLUTE NO-QUESTION RULE:
You must NEVER ask the user whether to increase / raise / change quantities.
You must NEVER say "do you want to increase the quantity of X" or any paraphrase of it.
You must NEVER return intent "reply" or "clarify" here -- only "shopping_sync".
The user has ALREADY approved adding the missing ingredients. They edit quantities manually in the shopping-list UI if needed.

CRITICAL QUANTITY EXTRACTION RULE:
Look back at YOUR previous "recipe_overview" turn in this conversation. You built a "missing" array where each entry had qty_needed like "200 גרם" or "3 יחידות" or "5 דפים". For EACH of those missing items, extract the FIRST integer you see in qty_needed and put it in requested_qty. Put the remaining text (the unit) in "unit".

WORKED EXAMPLE (follow this pattern EXACTLY):
Suppose the recipe_overview missing list was:
  {{"name": "סלמון טרי", "qty_needed": "200 גרם"}}
  {{"name": "אורז סושי", "qty_needed": "300 גרם"}}
  {{"name": "אצות נורי", "qty_needed": "5 דפים"}}
  {{"name": "חומץ אורז", "qty_needed": "50 מ״ל"}}
  {{"name": "סוכר", "qty_needed": "2 כפות"}}
  {{"name": "מלח", "qty_needed": "1 כפית"}}
  {{"name": "ווסאבי", "qty_needed": "10 גרם"}}
  {{"name": "אבוקדו", "qty_needed": "1 יחידה"}}

Your shopping_sync JSON MUST be:
{{
  "intent": "shopping_sync",
  "items_to_add": [
    {{"item_name": "סלמון טרי",  "requested_qty": 200, "unit": "גרם",  "category": "Seafood",  "sub_category": ""}},
    {{"item_name": "אורז סושי",   "requested_qty": 300, "unit": "גרם",  "category": "Pantry",   "sub_category": ""}},
    {{"item_name": "אצות נורי",   "requested_qty": 5,   "unit": "דפים", "category": "Pantry",   "sub_category": ""}},
    {{"item_name": "חומץ אורז",   "requested_qty": 50,  "unit": "מ״ל",  "category": "Pantry",   "sub_category": ""}},
    {{"item_name": "סוכר",        "requested_qty": 2,   "unit": "כפות", "category": "Pantry",   "sub_category": ""}},
    {{"item_name": "מלח",         "requested_qty": 1,   "unit": "כפית", "category": "Pantry",   "sub_category": ""}},
    {{"item_name": "ווסאבי",      "requested_qty": 10,  "unit": "גרם",  "category": "Pantry",   "sub_category": ""}},
    {{"item_name": "אבוקדו",      "requested_qty": 1,   "unit": "יחידה","category": "Produce",  "sub_category": ""}}
  ],
  "spoken_confirmation": "הוספתי לרשימת הקניות סלמון 200 גרם אורז סושי 300 גרם נורי 5 דפים חומץ אורז 50 מ״ל סוכר 2 כפות מלח 1 כפית ווסאבי 10 גרם ואבוקדו 1 יחידה"
}}

⚠ NEVER hardcode requested_qty=1. Pulling the FIRST number from qty_needed is MANDATORY.
⚠ The spoken_confirmation MUST list every item WITH its quantity and unit in {target_lang}.

=====================================================================
[STATE 6 - SAVE CURRENT RECIPE TO DB]
=====================================================================
Trigger: The user says ANYTHING that expresses a wish to save/store/keep the recipe for later use. Examples in any language:
  - "save this recipe"
  - "save the recipe"
  - "save it in your DB"
  - "keep this recipe"
  - "save the recipe as X" (user names it)

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- You MUST return intent "save_recipe".
- You must NEVER ask the user WHERE to save. The recipes database is a single internal SQLite file managed by this integration -- there is no choice of location.
- You must NEVER suggest creating a sub-location, folder, or path for the recipe. That is inventory-agent behaviour and does NOT apply to recipes.
- The code will read the FULL steps/ingredients/timers directly from CURRENT RECIPE STATE -- you do NOT need to re-emit them. Send an EMPTY "steps": [] array; the agent will substitute the real ones from state.
- The ONLY field you MUST extract correctly is "recipe_name" -- this is usually given by the user in the message itself ("save as X" / "שמור בשם X"). If not given, use the recipe_title from CURRENT RECIPE STATE.

{{
  "intent": "save_recipe",
  "recipe_name": "<name the user provided, or recipe_title from state>",
  "ingredients": [],
  "steps": [],
  "timers": [],
  "tags": ["<lowercase tag>", "<lowercase tag>"],
  "spoken_confirmation": "<short in {target_lang}, e.g. 'Saved the recipe'>"
}}

=====================================================================
[STATE 8 - JUMP TO A SPECIFIC STEP]
=====================================================================
CRITICAL Trigger: The CURRENT RECIPE STATE has a non-empty "steps" array AND the user asks to jump/skip/go to a specific NUMBERED step. Examples in any language:
  - "skip to step 4"
  - "go to step 3"
  - "jump to step 2"
  - "go back to step 1"
  - "קפוץ לשלב 4"
  - "לך לשלב 3"
  - "חזור לשלב 2"
  - "תעבור לשלב 5"

You MUST extract the integer step number mentioned by the user. 1-based counting: step 1 is the first step, step 2 is the second, etc.

If the user asks to jump when CURRENT RECIPE STATE has NO steps (overview-only), DO NOT return jump_to_step — that is an error condition. Instead return intent "init_recipe" to rebuild the recipe first.

Output JSON:
{{
  "intent": "jump_to_step",
  "step_number": <integer 1-based, MANDATORY>,
  "spoken_confirmation": "<short in {target_lang}, e.g. 'Jumping to step 4'>"
}}

=====================================================================

=====================================================================
[STATE 7 - MANUAL DICTATION MODE START]
=====================================================================
Trigger: User wants to dictate a new recipe themselves (e.g. "add a new recipe").
{{
  "intent": "manual_start",
  "recipe_name": "<short name in {target_lang}, best guess from the request>",
  "spoken_prompt": "<Ask in {target_lang}: Okay let's build <name>. Tell me the first step, and say done when finished.>"
}}

=====================================================================
[STATE 9 - CONFIRM SWITCHING AWAY FROM ACTIVE RECIPE]
=====================================================================
Trigger: CURRENT RECIPE STATE has active all_steps AND the user EXPLICITLY asks for a different recipe using phrases like "new recipe", "different recipe", "switch recipe", "cancel this", "forget this recipe", "never mind", etc.

Do NOT silently switch -- ask the user to confirm first.

{{
  "intent": "confirm_switch_recipe",
  "new_recipe_hint": "<short name of the new dish they mentioned, or empty>",
  "spoken_question": "<Ask in {target_lang}, e.g.: We are in the middle of <current recipe>. Want to switch to <new dish> and lose progress?>"
}}

If the user confirms on the next turn, the agent will clear state and produce the normal recipe_overview / init_recipe flow for the new dish.

JSON ONLY:"""


def get_dictation_prompt(target_lang, history_text, working_recipe_str,
                        last_user_msg):
    return f"""You are recording a NEW recipe dictated by the user, step by step.

CURRENT WORKING RECIPE (in progress):

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:

CHAT HISTORY:

Your job: interpret the user's latest message and return EXACTLY ONE JSON intent below. Keep language in {target_lang}.

1. If the user is giving a new step (most common):

2. If the user says they are DONE / finished / save:
{{"intent": "finish", "spoken_confirmation": "<short in {target_lang}>"}}

3. If the user wants to REMOVE the last step / undo:
{{"intent": "undo_step", "spoken_ack": "<short in {target_lang}>"}}

4. If the user wants to cancel/abandon the dictation entirely:
{{"intent": "cancel", "spoken_ack": "<short in {target_lang}>"}}

5. If the user says something unrelated that is clearly not a step:
{{"intent": "clarify", "spoken_question": "<Ask in {target_lang} to state the next step or say done>"}}
